# ISE 453 - Modeling and Analysis of Supply Chains -- Case Study 1

Question 8.2
---
(9-Node UFLP Instance: Exact) The file 9node.xlsx lists the x- and y-coordinates, demands hi, and fixed costs fj for each node, as well as the transportation cost cij between each pair of nodes i and j. Transportation costs equal 10 times the Euclidean distance between the nodes. All fixed costs equal 200. Solve this instance of the UFLP exactly by implementing the UFLP in the modeling language of your choice and solving it with a MIP solver. Report the optimal locations, optimal assignments, and optimal cost.

Question 8.5
---
(9-node pMP Instance: Exact) Using the file 9node.xlsx (see Problem 8.2), solve the pMP exactly by implementing it in the modeling language of your choice and solving it with a MIP solver. Ignore the fixed costs in the data set and use p = 4. Report the optimal locations, optimal assignments, and optimal cost.

Question 8.8
---
(9-node SCLP Instance) Using the file 9node.xlsx (see Problem 8.2), solve the SCLP exactly by implementing it in the modeling language of your choice and solving it with a MIP solver. Set the fixed cost of every facility equal to 1. Assume that facility j covers customer i if cij ≤ 2.5. Report the optimal locations.

Question 8.9
---
(9-node MCLP Instance) Using the file 9node.xlsx (see Problem 8.2), solve the MCLP exactly by implementing it in the modeling language of your choice and solving it with a MIP solver. Set p = 4. Assume that facility j covers customer i if cij ≤ 2.5. Report the optimal locations and the total number of demands covered.
