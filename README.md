## Case Study 1
# Question 8.2
---
(9-Node UFLP Instance: Exact) The file 10node.xlsx contains data for a 10-
node instance of the UFLP, with nodes located on the unit square and I = J, pictured
in Figure 8.22. The file lists the x- and y-coordinates, demands hi, and fixed costs fj
for each node, as well as the transportation cost cij between each pair of nodes i and j.
Transportation costs equal 10 times the Euclidean distance between the nodes. All fixed
costs equal 200.
Solve this instance of the UFLP exactly by implementing the UFLP in the modeling
language of your choice and solving it with a MIP solver. Report the optimal locations,
optimal assignments, and optimal cost.
